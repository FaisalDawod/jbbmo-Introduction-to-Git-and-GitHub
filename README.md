## Simple Interest Calculator
This is a simple calculator that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

### Usage
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li> Input the principal amount ('p'). </li>
  <li> Input the time period in years ('t'). </li>
  <li> Input the annual rate of interest ('r'). </li>
  <li> The calculator will output the simple interest, calculated using the formula: 'simple interest = p * t * r'. </li>
</ol>

### Example
For example, if you have a principal amount of $1000, a time period of 5 years, and an annual interest rate of 5%, the calculator will output:

```
Input:
   p = 1000
   t = 5
   r = 0.05
Output:
   Simple Interest = 250
```
